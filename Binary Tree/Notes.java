// Program to Determine if given Two Trees are identical or not
/*
 * Two trees are indentical when they have the same data and the arrgangement of
 * data is also the same.
 */

/*
 * Approach:
 * To identify if two trees are identical, we need to traverse both trees
 * simultanously, and while traversing we need to compare data and children of
 * trees.
