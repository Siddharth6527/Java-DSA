### Types of Shift Operators ###
 
 Signed Left Shift(<<): 
 The left shift operator moves all bits by a given number of bits to the left.

 Signed Right Shift(>>):
 The right shift operator moves all bits by a given number of bits to the right.

 Unsigned Right Shift(>>>):
 It is the sames as the signed right shift, but the vacant leftmost position is filled with 0 instead of the sign bit.

 1. Signed Left Shift Operator in Java:
 This operator is represented by a symbol <<, read as double less than.
 Syntax:
 left_operant << number

 Calculating the value of number<<2 if number = 2.
 When the value of a number is shifted to the left two places, the leftmost two bits are lost.
 The number has value of two.
 0010 is the binary representation of the number 2.

 2. Signed Right Shift Operator in java:
 The Right Shift Operator moves the bits of a number in a given number of places to the right.

 When we shfit a number to the right, the least significant bits (rightmost) are deleted, and the sign bit is filled in the most considerable place (leftmost).

 3. Unsigned Right Shift Operator in Java:
 Unsigned Right Shift Operator moves the bit of the integer a given number of places to the right.
 The sign bit was filled with 0s.

 Note: For Negative bits, the signed and unsigned right shift operators provide different results.
