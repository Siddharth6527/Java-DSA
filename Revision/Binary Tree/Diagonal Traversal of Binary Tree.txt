### Diagonal Traversal of Binary Tree ###
 
 Consider lines with a slope of -1 that cross through nodes.
 Print all diagonal elements in a binary tree that belong to the same line, given a binary tree.

 Observation: root and root->right values will be prioritized over all root->left values.

 The plan is to make use of a map.
 Different slope distances are used in the map as a key.
 The map's value is a node vector (or dynamic array).
 To save values in the map, we traverse the tree.
 We print the content of the map after it has been constructed.
