// Introduction to Knapsack Problem, its types, and How to solve them.
 The Knapsack problem is an example of the combinaltional optimization problem.
 This problem is also commonly known as the "Rucksack Problem".
 The name of the problem is defined from the maximization problem as mentioned below:

 Given a bag with maximum weight capacity of W and a set of items, each having a weight and a value associated with it.
 Decide the number of each item to take in a collection such that the total weight is less than the capacity and the total value is maximized.
