### Printing all subsets using Bit Manipulation ###
 
 Below are the step-by-step appraoch:
 1. Iterate numbers from 0 to (2^n)-1.
 2. Generate binary representation of that number and include the elements of array as per below cases:
  If the i'th bit is 1, then include i'th element of the array into the current subset.
  If the i'th bit is 0, do nothing and continue.

 Each bit representation of the number will give a unique subset.
