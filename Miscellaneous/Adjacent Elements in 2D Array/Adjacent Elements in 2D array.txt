### Find all adjacent elements of given element in a 2D Array or Matrix ###
 
 Given a two-dimensional integer array arr[][], return all the adjacent elements of particular integer whose position is given as (x,y)

 Adjacent elements are all the elements that share a common side or point, i.e. they have a vertical, horizontal or diagonal distance of 1.

 //////////////////////
 Method 1: In this approach, we have to check for all the possible adjacent positions and print them as the adjacent elements of the given elements.

 The only problem is this approach is that a possible adjacent position may not be a valid position of the matrix, i.e. the index may be out of bound for the 2-dimensioal array.
 So we have to keep checking for every adjacent position if that is a valid position or not.

 Time Complexity: O(1)
 Auxiliary Space: O(1)

 /////////////////////////////////
 Method 2: In this approach, we will not check for every adjacent element whether it is a valid position or not, we will directly code in a way that it will only print the valid elements.

 We will iterate using two loops, where the outer loop dentoes deviation in a row number and the inner loop denotes deviation in column number.
 The deviation is in the range of -1 to 1 and gets adjusted based on the provided position.

 Here is only one special case: if both the deviations are 0 then it denotes the same element.
