### Packages in Java ###
 
 In Java, packages are used to organize classes into namespaces, providing a way to manage and categorize related classes and interfaces.
 Packages help prevent naming conflicts, improving code readibility, and facilitate modularization and reusability.
 Here are some of the key concepts related to Java packages:

 1. Package Declaration:
 At the beginning of each Java source file, you can declare the package to which the class belongs using the 'package' keyword.

 For example:
 package com.example.myproject;

 This declaration indicates that the class belongs to the:
 'com.example.myproject' package.

 2. Package Structure:
 Packages can be hierarchical, allowing you to organize classes into a directory-like structure.
 The package declaration reflects the hierarchy.

 For example, a class declaraed in the package 'com.example.myproject' would typically reside in a directory structure like 'com/example/myproject'.

 3. Import Statement: 
 To use classes from other packages in your code, you can use the 'import' statement.
 This statement informs the compiler where to find the referenced classes.

 For example, 
 import java.util.ArrayList;
 import java.util.List;

 This allow you to use classes from the 'java.util' package without fully qualifying their names.

 4. Default Package:
 If you do not specify a package for your classes, they belong to the default package, which has no name.
 It's generally recommended to avoid using the default package for non-trivial projects to prevent naming conflicts.

 5. Access Modifier and Package Visibility:
 Java provides four access modifiers ('public', 'protected', 'default', and 'private') to control the Visibility of classes, methods, and fiels.
 When no access modifier is specified, the default visibility is package-private, meaning the member is accessible only within its own package.

 6. Package Naming Conventions:
 By conventon, package names are written in lowercase letters to prevent conflicts with class names.
 The package name typically starts with the reversed domain name of the organization, followed by any sub-packages and finally the class name.

 7. Java Standard Library Packages:
 Java comes with a vast standard library that is organized into packages.
 Commonly used packages inlcude 'java.lang', 'java.util', 'java.io', 'java.net', and many more.

 8. Package Visibility and Modules:
 With the introduction of modules, additional levels ('exports', 'opens', etc) are provided to control the accessibility of packages and types outside of the module boundaries.
 Module offer a more fine-grained approach to encapsulation compared to packages.

Understanding and effectively utilizing packages is crucial for writing well-organized, modular, and maintainble Java applications.
The help in managing the complexity of large-scale projects and encourage code reuse across different parts of the application.
